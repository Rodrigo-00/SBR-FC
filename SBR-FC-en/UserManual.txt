To execute the program, the address where the SBR-FC.exe executable is located inside the device must be entered through a terminal. As parameters then separated by a space, the address must be indicated
of the file that contains the knowledge base. Finally, and as with the knowledge base, the path of the file that carries the fact base must be indicated. It should be noted that any of the files or the executable
They can be indicated without a path if we execute the program from the directory in which it is located. The files corresponding to the knowledge base and the fact base must be text files, the associated certainty factor
both the facts and the rules must be between [-1,1]. Both bases are composed of the following format:

	-The knowledge base is made up of a first line that indicates the number of rules it contains followed by the rules. Each of the rules is on a different line and contains the format
	<<Identificador: Regla, FC=factor>> where Rule contains the reserved word Then to indicate the consequent of the rule and the reserved conjunctions <<y, o>> that are used between the antecedents. In relation
	al Identifier this must be of the type Ri where i will be the number of the rule.

	-The fact base, like the knowledge base, contains as the first line the number of facts it contains followed by the facts in each line. The format of each line is in the form <<hecho, FC=factor>> .
	To indicate the objective of the program, put the word <<Objetivo>> in the penultimate line and in the next line the target fact from which the degree of certainty is to be obtained.

The program generates an output file whose name will be the union of the names of the knowledge base and the fact base with a .txt extension. This file will contain in the first two lines the name of the knowledge base
and the fact base used for the program and in the next line the objective fact. Next, the inference process followed until obtaining the certainty factor of the target event that will be indicated last will be shown.
